Challenge 2: WebDecode

Category: Web Exploitation / Encoding

Description:A webpage displays or hides content using encoded strings. The challenge is to decode multiple layers to reveal the flag.

SOLUTION APPROACH:

I visited the challenge webpage and started to inspect each and every website linked to it.
On the about webpage , when I inspected it and was scrolling through the HTML code I saw a very long suspicious value stored in the "notify_true" command.
Encoded value : cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9
It was encoded in base64 encryption language.
Using the base64 decode website I decoded the value and it revealed the flag
Decoded value : picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_02cdcb59}

FLAG : 
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_02cdcb59}

KEY TAKEAWAYS :
Always recognize common encodings:
== often → Base64
%20 or %3D → URL encoding
ROT13 often used for letters.
